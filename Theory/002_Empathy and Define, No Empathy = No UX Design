**The purpose of this tutorial**:
* Be familiar with first two stages of the designe thinking process
* Understand some key user research methods
* Craft your own HMW statement to guide you for the rest of the course

### I - Empathie and define: An introduction to the first two stages of the design thinking process

**Empathize** : instead of taking a wild guess at how you should design or improve a product, you find out from the people who use the product what the real problems or pain points are by conducting research. 

**Define** : Define more clearly the problem, goal, or pain point that will guide your design process.The goal here is to be able to determine the problem as **specifically** as possible without limiting the solutions you might come up with in the next stage.

### II - Empathy : Essential to UX design
**Great user experiences come from listening and understanding the needs of the people who will use or engage with the product youâ€™re designing.**
Great user experiences rarely happen by chance! They are the result of an intentional and iterative process, with empathy at its foundation.
**So what does empathy look like in UX design?** Two words: User Research.
User Reasearch : Users' needs, goals, pain points, and contexts. This research can take many forms, both **qualitative** and **quantitative**.
* **Qualitative research methods** : User interviews/ Focus groups/ Shadow sessions/ Diary studies
* **Quantitative research methods** : Analytics/ Mouse hearmaps/ Funnel analysis/ AB Testing

### III - How to define the "problem" in UX design
* **Wicked** problems: Tricky problems that are somewhat ambiguous, and that often involve many unknown factors.
* **Trame** problems: problems have easier or more definitive solutions.

* **HMW(How-Might-We)** :  You simply look through your user research (or your affinity diagram, if you created one) and start writing HMW statements related to the problems you see represented.
Exemples:
    * How might we help frontline workers tend to their mental health on their most intense days?
    * How might we help parents who work from home to find accessible and affordable child care?
    * How might we help people who live alone and experience isolation to find connection and support while working remotely?
