# The five stages of the Design Thinking process

#### I - Empathize: No empathize = No UX design
The UX designer connects with product users(or potential users) to understand their needs and goals,
and to get a sense of what problems or pain points could use some design thinking magic to solve.
Much of this stages consists of __UX RESEARCH__ (user interviews and surveys).

#### II - Define: No problem = No solution, HMW(How-might-we help)
Organizing the research results, sorting through the data, and looking at it from various perspectives.
The goal of this stage is to clearly define which problem(s) to focus on for the time being.

#### III - Ideate: Brainstorm, find all the ideas
The ideation stage is where UX designers come up with as many ideas as they can for how to solve the problem they’ve defined.
**No idea is a bad idea** : Later in this stage, the UX designer can work with others in their team or company to figure out which idea works best for the user and best meets business goals.

#### IV - Prototype
The goal of this stage is to create a working model (known as a **prototype**) of the idea to see how it will operate, and to work out any major issues in the design before moving forward.

#### V - Test
the UX designer tests the prototype with actual users to understand whether or not the solution meets users’ needs the way they expected, to find out if there are aspects of the problem that they’ve overlooked, and to see if the solution itself creates any new issues to be resolved.

***
**the Design Thinking process is recursive and iterative—meaning that it repeats over and over again, and that the stages won’t always be followed in this particular order.**
