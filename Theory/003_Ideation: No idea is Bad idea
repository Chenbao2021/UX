**By the end of this tutorial, you'll** :
* Be familiar with a few basic UX ideation methods
* Understand how to conduct an ideation session on your own(or adapt it for a group)
* Generate an idea in response to a HMW statement

### I - Ideate: An introduction to the third stage of the design thinking process
* Generating as many ideas as possible for how to solve or address the problem you've identified in the first two stages.

**No idea is Bad idea** : You can worry about budget, business goals, and any other considerations or constraints later. The feasibility of the idea isn't the most important thing right now, keep your originality !

### II - Essential UX ideation techniques
* Brainstorming and bodystorming
    - **Branstorming**: Share ideas as they come up, bouncing one idea off another and even combining this with a little mind-mapping. 
        You can also set up some audio or video recording and just talk through your ideas out loud! And don't hesitate if you need to move around , do yoga or other form of movement.
    * **Bodystorming** : Set up an experience or scenario that resembles the problem you are solving.
* Branwriting and brainwalking
    - **Brainwriting** : You write without filtering your ideas.(= Brainstorming on paper)
        In a group, you could simply set a timer and have everyone write down their ideas, then pass their idea to the next person who then reads the idea(s) and adds their own.
    - **Brainwalking** : Put sheets of paper at different places in the room. When a set amount of time passes, participants rotate to the next sheet of paper to read the idea and add their own.
* Crazy Eights 
    - **Goal**: To generate at least eight ideas for a mobile app that would help solve the problem in your HMW statement
    - Set your timer for 1 minute. In that time, sketch out one idea for how your digital product could address users' problems.(It should be messy!, the goal is to capture and idea and, without giving it too much rational thought, to give the idea some shape)
    **Just one sketch(brouillons) in one minute, and then stop.
    Repeat untile you have eight different solutions sketched out.
    - Take 1-2 minutes to reviez your ideas. You might see one or two that immediately stand out as your favorites for one reason or another.
    - In General, the best idea is one that:
        * Clearly and specifically addresses the user needs you've identified during your research
        * Can reasonably be implemented with the time and resources you have available to you 
        * Without creating other problems/issues that impact the feasibility of the project
        * Bonus: Can delight users!
* Mindmapping
    A visual map of your ideas that draws connections and highlights patterns in the ideas.
* SCAMPER
